Hi I'm Felix!
Currently doing some Stata stuff :)

You can find some of my work here
- [did_multiplegt_dyn](https://github.com/chaisemartinPackages/did_multiplegt_dyn.git): Estimation of event-study Difference-in-Difference (DID) estimators in designs with multiple groups and periods, and with a potentially non-binary treatment that may increase or decrease multiple times, based on de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfoeuille ([2024a](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3731856)).
- [did_had](https://github.com/chaisemartinPackages/did_had): Heterogeneity-robust DID estimator in heterogeneous adoption designs without stayers but with some quasi-stayers, based on de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille ([2024b](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4284811)).
